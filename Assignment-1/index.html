        I joined the AltSchoolAfrica to be be to adequately equip myself for the future,i had always wanted to have a tech career since 2019 but have had different issues financially also not having a laptop made me shelve it but seeing the Grade A scholaship opportunity,
        I decided i wasnt going to wait any longer and would just start my tech career journey. 
        <P>My goal is to  solve problems through technology and also hope that through it i become more financially stable, for example solving the tedious house hunting process via a dedicated app, where landlords and potential tenants can communicate and houses available for rent are properly documented and listed so clients can fromthe comort of their home choose homes they ant and easily locate them for inspection thus eleminating the very uncomfortable house agency program and I'm hoping through the AltSchool Africa School of Engineering I can be equipped ro do this.</p>
